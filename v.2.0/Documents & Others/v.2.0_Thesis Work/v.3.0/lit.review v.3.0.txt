**Literature Review: A Survey on Sitting Posture Monitoring Systems**

Spinal pain, particularly caused by poor sitting posture, has become a widespread issue affecting both adults and adolescents. The prolonged usage of computers, tablets, and other portable electronic devices is a primary contributor to back problems, including neck pain, low back pain, and hyperkyphosis. With a growing number of individuals experiencing these issues, there has been an increasing need for posture monitoring systems that aim to evaluate and correct sitting posture to prevent such health problems. This literature review explores recent advances in sitting posture monitoring systems, focusing on the types of postures being analyzed and the sensor technologies utilized in these systems.

### **Posture Types in Sitting Posture Monitoring Systems**

Sitting posture monitoring systems are designed to evaluate various sitting positions that can contribute to spinal issues. A typical classification of sitting postures includes different variations of seated positions, each of which can influence spinal health. Several studies, such as those by Jongryun et al. [14], have categorized sitting postures into distinct types based on factors like the presence or absence of a backrest and the angle of inclination relative to the seat. The postures discussed in the literature are as follows:

1. **Upright Sitting with Backrest**: This posture represents an ideal sitting position where the person maintains a neutral spine alignment with the backrest providing support.
   
2. **Upright Sitting without Backrest**: In this posture, the person maintains an upright position without the support of a backrest, which could potentially lead to strain on the lower back if sustained over time.

3. **Front Sitting with Backrest**: In this posture, the individual leans forward but still utilizes a backrest for support.

4. **Front Sitting without Backrest**: This position involves leaning forward without the support of a backrest, potentially causing increased stress on the spine.

5. **Left Sitting and Right Sitting**: These two postures involve sitting on either side of the body, which may not provide optimal spinal alignment if done for prolonged periods.

These postures represent the core focus of posture monitoring systems, as they are the primary determinants of spinal health. Monitoring the transition between these postures and the potential effects of prolonged sitting in suboptimal positions is essential for preventing musculoskeletal disorders.

### **Sensor Technologies in Posture Monitoring Systems**

A critical aspect of posture monitoring systems is the sensors used to track and analyze sitting positions. Over the years, various sensor technologies have been developed and integrated into posture monitoring systems. These sensors provide the necessary data to detect posture changes and provide feedback to users in real-time. The following sensor technologies have been widely used in the literature to assess sitting posture:

#### **1. Pressure Sensors**

Pressure sensors are one of the most commonly used technologies for sitting posture monitoring. These sensors measure the distribution of weight across different points of contact, such as the backrest and seat plate of a chair. Pressure sensors can classify different sitting postures based on the weight distribution detected by the sensors.

Jongryun et al. [14] proposed a system that integrates load cells into the seat plate and backrest plate to detect various sitting postures. The system was able to detect posture changes and classify different sitting types, including upright and forward leaning postures. Similarly, Bilal El-Sayed et al. [16] used a combination of inclinometer and weight sensors to detect sitting, standing, and walking postures by analyzing weight distribution and body inclination.

Despite their widespread use, pressure sensor-based systems face limitations, particularly in terms of portability. These systems often require a fixed setup, such as sensors mounted under the chair legs or seat plate, which restricts their use to specific environments such as offices or homes.

#### **2. Inertial Sensors**

Inertial sensors, particularly accelerometers and gyroscopes, have gained popularity in posture monitoring due to their portability and small size. These sensors measure the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the body, which can be used to infer posture and body orientation. Inertial sensors can be embedded in wearable devices or clothing, making them ideal for continuous posture monitoring without the need for external equipment.

Wai Yin Wong and Man Sang Wong [20] proposed a posture monitoring system using three inertial sensors placed at different points along the body: the upper trunk, mid trunk, and pelvic levels. These sensors track the curvature of the spine during movement and provide feedback on spinal alignment. A similar system was developed by Azin Fathi and Kevin Curran [22], where three inertial units were placed on the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spine to monitor hunched and slouched postures. The data collected from these sensors were analyzed using classification algorithms to identify poor postures.

While inertial sensors offer high portability and ease of use, they are sensitive to placement and orientation. The accuracy of posture detection can be compromised if the sensors are misaligned or displaced during use. Additionally, these systems can be invasive since they require sensors to be attached directly to the body.

#### **3. Flexible Sensors**

Flexible sensors are another emerging technology in posture monitoring systems. These sensors are made from flexible materials that can be easily integrated into clothing or worn on the body without restricting movement. Flexible sensors can detect bending or stretching, making them suitable for monitoring spinal curvature.

Manju Gopinath and Angeline Kirubha [25] proposed a system using flexible sensors to detect the bend of the spine. The flexible sensors were placed on the mid-thoracic region of the spine to monitor posture. The system combined the flexible sensors with a load cell to detect spinal stress and improve the accuracy of posture detection. However, the flexibility of the sensors presents challenges in terms of positioning, as poor placement may result in inaccurate posture detection.

#### **4. Inductor Sensors**

Inductor-based posture monitoring systems measure the deformation of the body by monitoring the changes in inductance caused by the stretching or compressing of an inductor sensor. These sensors are often used in wearable garments such as T-shirts, where they can track body deformation due to changes in posture.

Emilio Sardini et al. [26] proposed a posture monitoring T-shirt that integrates an inductor sensor across the back and chest. The system detects body elongation and straightening by measuring the inductance variation caused by the deformation of the body. This system was capable of providing real-time feedback on posture through vibro-feedback sensors. However, inductor-based systems are limited in their ability to detect lateral (left or right) body deformations and are more suited for sagittal plane (front-back) posture analysis.

#### **5. Optical Fiber Sensors**

Optical fiber sensors have been explored as a novel solution for posture monitoring. These sensors use light transmission through optical fibers to detect curvature changes in the body. The amount of light detected by the sensor varies depending on the curvature of the body, which can be used to determine posture.

Dunne et al. [27] developed a posture monitoring system that uses optical fiber sensors to assess the spine’s curvature. The system consists of a light source and a light sensor attached to the ends of optical fibers, integrated into a garment. The amount of light transmitted between the source and sensor is used to determine spinal alignment. However, optical fiber-based systems are highly sensitive to sensor positioning, and any slippage of the fiber can lead to errors in posture evaluation.

### **Discussion and Conclusion**

Sitting posture monitoring systems have made significant strides in recent years, driven by advancements in sensor technology. Pressure sensors, inertial sensors, flexible sensors, inductor sensors, and optical fiber sensors each have their own advantages and limitations. Pressure sensor-based systems offer reliable weight distribution data but are limited by their lack of portability. Inertial sensors, while portable and effective, suffer from accuracy issues related to sensor alignment. Flexible sensors provide a low-cost and adaptable solution but face challenges with positioning. Inductor and optical fiber sensors offer novel approaches to posture monitoring but are restricted to specific posture types and are sensitive to sensor misplacement.

Despite these challenges, the field of posture monitoring systems continues to evolve, with future research focusing on improving accuracy, portability, and user comfort. The integration of multiple sensing technologies, such as combining inertial sensors with pressure or load sensors, may offer more robust solutions. Additionally, the development of wireless and non-invasive systems will likely improve the user experience and broaden the application of posture monitoring systems in both clinical and everyday settings.

In conclusion, sitting posture monitoring systems play a crucial role in preventing and managing spinal health issues by providing real-time feedback and correction. The future of posture monitoring lies in the continued development of wearable, non-invasive systems that integrate various sensor technologies for more accurate and comprehensive posture analysis.
