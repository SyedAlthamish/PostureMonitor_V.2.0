    File Description:
    
    Short: 
        this file is a basic implementation of real-time inputting of sensor data and outputting of lstm-classified
        labels from an imported trained lstm classifier.
    
    Long:
        This script implements an LSTM-based posture classification system for live data processing on a 
        Raspberry Pi 5. It begins by loading the necessary preprocessing tools, including a StandardScaler for 
        feature scaling and a LabelEncoder for mapping predictions back to posture labels. The TensorFlow Lite 
        (.tflite) model is then loaded and allocated with input and output tensors for inference. A serial connection 
        is established to receive real-time sensor data from an external device, with adjustable port and baud rate 
        settings. Incoming data is read, decoded, and converted into a numerical array, ensuring it matches the expected 
        input format. The data is then standardized using the preloaded scaler and reshaped to fit the LSTM modelâ€™s 
        input structure. The model makes predictions, which are mapped back to posture labels using the label encoder. 
        The script continuously processes live sensor data and prints the predicted posture, along with specific messages
        for different classifications, such as "Neutral posture," "Slouching," "Hunching," or "Leaning" in various 
        directions.
