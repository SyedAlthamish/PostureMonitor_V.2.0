Our system's design is aimed around the objective of efficient and accurate monitoring of the sitting posture. As a result, its final design comprises of 3 sensors whose raw data in used to extract a derived feature known as tilt. The best performing variation of tilt derivation is deemed from the complementary filter's derivation. The best classifier to identify the posture is found out to be KNN classifier which provided an accuracy of 94%. Though the classifier has been trained from a limited dataset of only 12 people, the system would benefit from more data to be trained with. It has also been found out that an additional third sensor in the posterior of the body seems to reduce the accuracy of the classifier, therefore labelling it unnecessary.

Conclusion:
The task of posture monitoring with IMU sensors is a difficult but possible task with our system providing 94% accuracy. This system can be used to primarily monitor sitting posture ideally during seated work. The use of IMU sensor allow for maximum privacy to the user's actions while maintaining a decent level of accuracy. Due to its low power nature it can be used anywhere and can be thus used to acquire postural data over large periods of time with very little effort from the user's side.  However its design could benefit from improvements with the reduction of the processing unit's size and increase its flexibility by the addition of flexible electronics. The system's could increase its performance with the general population by having access to a large variety of patients data, involving patients from a wide variety of ages, weights and heights. Furthermore, the calibration routine undergone by the user at the start of every monitoring period can also be replaced by efficient, less time-consuming methods that do not impose restrictions on the user. The convenient setup of a shoulder strap can be replaced with textile-embedded electronics to further enhance the user's comfort.

### IV. Result
Our system is designed to efficiently and accurately monitor sitting posture. The final design comprises three sensors whose raw data is used to extract a derived feature known as tilt. The complementary filter's tilt derivation was found to be the best-performing variation. The KNN classifier, which provided 94% accuracy, was deemed the best model for identifying posture. Although the classifier was trained with a limited dataset of only 12 people, the system would benefit from more data. It was also found that an additional third sensor on the posterior of the body reduced the classifier's accuracy, rendering it unnecessary.

### V. Conclusion
Posture monitoring with IMU sensors is a challenging but achievable task, with our system providing 94% accuracy. This system is ideal for monitoring sitting posture during seated work. IMU sensors provide maximum privacy while maintaining decent accuracy. Due to its low-power nature, the system can be used anywhere, acquiring postural data over long periods with minimal effort from the user. However, the design could benefit from improvements, such as reducing the size of the processing unit and increasing its flexibility through the use of flexible electronics. The system's performance with the general population could improve with access to a larger and more diverse dataset, including individuals of varying ages, weights, and heights. Furthermore, the calibration routine at the start of each monitoring period could be replaced with more efficient, less time-consuming methods that do not impose restrictions on the user. The shoulder strap could be replaced with textile-embedded electronics to enhance user comfort. Finally, incorporating the ML algorithm into the processing unit would allow the system to function as a stand-alone device.
