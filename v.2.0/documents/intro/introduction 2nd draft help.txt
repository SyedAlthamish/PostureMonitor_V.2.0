{This file is designed to help the drafting of introduction part of the posture monitoring system project/research paper with the help of other base posture monitoring research papers and is arranged in the following way:
d1 indicating the 1st draft i.e. 6th sem thesis paper
bp1-5: indicating base papers 1-5 whose link is listed under each ind. topic in the draft named 'introduction 2nd draft.docx'; additionally the links are provided at notion at https://www.notion.so/Technical-Paper-Review-Innovation-List-6cf34aff9f2546c5a91bd531fab431ce?pvs=4#28ae96842d9e4207ad33f662d8a4afd2

Each paper has points extracted and then marked with @ to be then listed in an order to be established in draft paper}
