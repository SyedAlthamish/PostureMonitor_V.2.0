syed3 & syed4 were taken on 22.02 on 26-8-24 at syed's home place

The dataset follows the code commit id: 40d7f9b313614b074c3b23227cb2b5372afa853e with name "Further reduced sampling rate"

Follows changes to additional features and reduced timing redundancy

The following details the format of the dataset:


Calibrating gyroscope...
Gyroscope calibration complete. sensor1_gyro_biasx sensor1_gyro_biasy sensor1_gyro_biasz 
Calibrating gyroscope...
Gyroscope calibration complete. sensor2_gyro_biasx sensor2_gyro_biasy sensor2_gyro_biasz
Calibrating gyroscope...
Gyroscope calibration complete. sensor3_gyro_biasx sensor3_gyro_biasy sensor3_gyro_biasz
variance checks out sensor1_biasedgyro_variancex sensor1_biasedgyro_variancey sensor1_biasedgyro_variancez 
variance doesn't check out
sensor2_biasedgyro_variancex sensor2_biasedgyro_variancey sensor2_biasedgyro_variancez 
variance checks out sensor3_biasedgyro_variancex sensor3_biasedgyro_variancey sensor3_biasedgyro_variancez 


{the following entails a tabular data representation with the following columns seperated by "spaces"}
