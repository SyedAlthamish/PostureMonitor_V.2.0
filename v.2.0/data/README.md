ML_Ready Datasets contains columns and rows that are relevant to a specific machine learning model. These datasets are ready to be used for training and testing machine learning models.

Raw Datasets & Timestamps contains the original data that was collected from various sources. These datasets may contain irrelevant columns and rows that are not needed for the machine learning models. but are useful for analysis.

ML-Ready-with_rows contains datasets that have rows that are unnecessary for ML but may prove to be useful for analysis. However, They have structured and relevant columns, unlike raw datasets.
