This folder contains the Structured,Labelled, row-cleaned Datasets that are extracted from raw datasets obtained directly from the MC's outputs with the irrelevant columns and rows removed exactly as needed for the machine learning models.

The format of each .txt file is as follows:
    6* 2 values of one sensor, 6 *2 values of another sensor, posture state (Each Column is also labelled)
    with each row having only relevant posture states.

The actual dataset consists solely of ***n naming convention where the starts represent characters and the n represents optional number.

*Special Note: phar has corrupted data for s1 data due to powering down and up in between the protocol*
